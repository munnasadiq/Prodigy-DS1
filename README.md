Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization
You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the population distribution of COUNTRIES or YEARS.
### Population Age Distribution Visualization
This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the country's population demographics.

## Introduction
Understanding the distribution of the population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualization.
## Prerequisites
Before using the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
-Python 3.x
-Pandas
-Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib

# Getting Started
1. Data Preparation
- Ensure you have the relevant population data in a CSV file (e.g., "population.csv") in the same directory as your script.
- The CSV file should contain a column with years.

2. Running the Script
- Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
- Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.

3. Executing the Visualization
- Run the script.
- The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the distribution in the population dataset.

# Usage
Use this project to:
- Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
- Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.

# Customization
You can customize the visualization by making the following modifications to the code:
- Adjust the appearance of the bar chart, such as labels, colors, and size, to suit your preferences.

# Examples
Here's an example of how the population distribution bar chart might look:
